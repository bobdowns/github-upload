      <h1>Who I Am and How to Use This Portfolio</h1>
      <p>Hi! My name is Bob Downs. I'm a meticulous Web Designer. This website
        showcases what I've learned while earning my Associate in Applied
        Science Computer Technology degree, Certificate of Completion Computer
        Usage and Applications, and Certificate of Completion Web Design: User
        Interface from Rio Salado College in Tempe, Arizona.
      </p>
      <p>It further showcases what I've learned while earning my Bachelor in
        Applied Science Internet and Web Development degree from Arizona State
        University in Tempe, Arizona.
      </p>
      <p>Clicking on the menu items to the left will lead you to the various web
        design works I've created while earning the above degrees and
        certificates. And, the Resume menu item will show you my resume and make
        it available for download. These items will show you the breadth and depth
        of my knowledge in web design, web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
        jQuery &amp; AJAX), user interface design, user experience design, design
        principles like color theory, Gestalt Principles, as well as Adobe
        software such as Photoshop, Illustrator, Animate (Flash), and After
        Effects.
      </p>
      <h2>Additional Things I've Learned</h2>
      <p>I've also taught myself to register domain names and set up web hosting
        at GoDaddy, Namecheap, Hostinger, and WPEngine. And, before I'd finished
        my associate's degree, I single-handedly converted a high school PTO's
        Microsoft Frontpage website into a WordPress website in 2012. I then
        greatly increased its utility by adding the ability for parents to donate
        to the PTO via PayPal. I developed a publishing schedule and proofread and
        edited various contributors' articles before posting them on the new
        website. Further, I developed and refined the PTO's Constant Contact
        weekly eNewsletter, increasing readership by 35%.
